We want to change these in our case to better reflect the style of the original site. \nThe way we do this is with the set_custom_scss method of the BlogArticle format. Each article format has its own default CSS theme. You can customize certain variables in the theme while largely sticking to the default. \nHere s what the custom SCSS looks like for customizing the font \nEach of these variables governs a font used for a particular purpose in the rendered asset. In our case we ll stick with Source Sans as the font just as the original blog does. \nWe also want to customize the color scheme to look more like the original blog. Here s some SCSS to do that \nJust as with the fonts these are variables specific to the BlogArticle s default theme. \nPutting it all together we add the following lines to our ingester in the same place where we set all the metadata on the post asset \nThe import _default brings in the default theme for BlogArticle. We can add custom SCSS rules to do further customization after the import line but we re not going to do that in this example. You can also leave out the import line if you want to start from scratch and write your own theme. \nRe run the ingester and view the hatch with Hatch Previewer you should see the effects of our customizations in the rendered HTML and also in the embedded CSS when you click the Flip button. \n"});
