<h1>Cockney Lorem Ipsum</h1>
<p>Cockney lorem ipsum, cor blimey guv, would you Adam and Eve it, get up those apples to bed! Pass the army will you, she has such long bacon, I'm going to have my barnet cut. Hand over the bees, what knobbly biscuits you got. We don't have to have a bull about it, I had a butchers at it through the window and you're talking cobblers! Use your crust, lad, she's a bit daffy and you're getting on my wick! Stick that up your Khyber and think about it; use your loaf. What beautiful minces, could you lend me an Oxford? It pens a bit in here, and I don't know what she's rabbiting about with her cockney rhyming slang. I can smell a raspberry, so scarpa, the trouble's been shopping again and I'm ironing my Uncle, now where's my weasel?

I've got an artful to help pay the rent, you have got a lovely set of Bacons. I shook him by the brass, and I wish I had loads of bread. See ya Slater, take a butcher's at that, I'm cream crackered! The currant bun's hot today so I'll give you a lift in the danny. He hasn't said a dicky bird in hours, she's always on the dog. Ain't seen you in Donkeys, ham'n'cheesy does it. Me jam jar's cream crackered and I really need to go for a Jimmy. It was Lemon, mate, he rarely using his loaf of bread so everything's gone Pete Tong. I was walking down the Plate, but I've also been on me Plates all day as he's always telling porkies. She Rabbits on a bit cos that bloke's a complete Richard. Here come the Sweeney, check out the syrup on is head, he's a bloody Tea Leaf, I just got a new Whistle.

</p><ul>
    <li>Quid is for bin lid and is worth one. Lady is for Lady Godiva, and it's worth a fiver</li>
    <li>Cockle is for cock and hen, and that will give you ten. Score is for apple core, and that will be twenty</li>
    <li>Pony will get you twenty five and a ton will get you one hundred</li>
    <li>Monkey is worth five hundred and a grand is a thousand</li>
</ul>

I found him lying in the bread and butter. She had beautiful mincers, so I'm going down the fatboy, come on don't just stand there, use your loaf, me plates are killing me. She must be going out as she's had her barnet done.
